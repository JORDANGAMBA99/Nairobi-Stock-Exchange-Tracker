Welcome to my Excel Visualisation For the Nairobi Stock Exchange

### Objective
I wanted to Visualise the Trade Volume, Trade Value, and Total Trades that took place in the Nairobi Stock Exchange on the given dates.(Although not specified accurately)

I found that the best visualization chart to use as a bar graph that had an accurate depiction of TradeVolume, TradeValue and Total Trades

### Trade Volume, Trade Value, and Total Trades For Egyptian Companies

<h1>Traded Volume</h1>

<h1>Trade Value</h1>

<h1>Total Trades</h1>
<img src-"Total Trades per Company for Egyptian companies in NSE.jpg">

The companies that had the best valuation were the Egyptian companies:
 -AIFI - Atlas For Investment and Food Industries
 -GGCC - Giza General Contracting and Real Estate Investment Co

Also, they maintained that most trades were done between these two companies. I suspect because of the low opening prices encourage more traders actually to trade with these stocks the most.

For Kenyan Companies the stock that had the most volume was Equity-EQY
Overall the Kenyan companies and Nigerian companies had low trade volumes, trade value, and the no.of trades executed where very low.
